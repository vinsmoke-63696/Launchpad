Here's a breakdown of what is intened out of this repository. 

        -- I am a senior backend developer with specialization in java, springboot, aws. 
        -- I've divided the tech and given them some weightage based on the demand and typical importance for each skill required in the market. 
        -- I will be creating some content around the topics and there weights that will reflect my preparation for the interviews.
        -- I will also write some core concepts here as we move ahead with preparations of our topics.

Here's a division of the skills out of the scale of **100%**

![Pie Chart Description](https://github.com/vinsmoke-63696/Launchpad/blob/main/skills.png?raw=true)

<br>

**1. Java (Core and Advanced) - 30%**
   - You'll need a solid understanding of OOP Principles, multi-threading, collections, streams and Java's newer features.

**2. Spring Boot - 25%**
   - Mastering spring boot annotations, dependency injection, AOP, spring security and spring data.

**3. Databases (SQL and NoSQL) - 15%**
   - For that flavour of a balanced profile

**4. Microservices - 15%**
   - Service decomposition, inter-service communication, API gateway design and more

**5. AWS - 15%**
   - Critical for scalable and distributed systems, knowledge of core AWS Services (EC2, S3, RDS, Lambda etc)

**6. Bonus section (No weightage tools)**
   - CICD tools, Git, and add ons like terraform, kafka, splunk etc.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am going to divide Java and Spring boot into further segments, as they cover more than 50% on there own.
<br><br>
**A. Java (Core and Advanced) - 100%**

**1. OOP Principles and Design Patterns - 25%**
   - Mastering these two are must to write clean code. 

**2. Collection Framework - 20%**
   - For all that data manipulation, lists, sets, maps and queues along with performance implications is importance. 
   - You got to be able to play with the data all they way you want. Remember client applications are grumpy about the way they receive the data.

**3. Java Streams and Lambda Expressions - 15%**
   - You should be able to handle large data sets, to do that you should know how to use map, filter, reduce and method references.

**4. Concurrency & Multithreading - 15%**
   - Threads, synchronization, executors, callable, future, all of them are essential for performance in multi-threaded env.
   - java.util.concurrent package 

**5. Memory Management & Garbage Collection - 10%**
   - Learn all there is to learn about this

**6. Exception Handeling - 10%**
   - Checked vs. unchecked exceptions.
   - Best practices in error handeling

**7. JVM Internals - 5%**
   - Class loader, heap, stack and about execution of bytecode

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**B. Spting Boot - 100%**

**1. Spring Core (Dependency Injection, IOC) - 25%**
   - How to use DI and IOC
   - Understanding annotations like @component, @Autowired, @Bean and @Configuration

**2. Spring Boot Annotations and Configurations - 20%**
   - @SpringBootApplication, @ConfigurationProperties, @Value @ExceptionHandler and all more of these annotations
   - ApplicationContext, Beanfactory, YAML properties and other terminologies and there working

**3. REST APIs (Spring MVC) - 15%**
   - @RestController, @RequestMapping, @GetMapping, @PostMapping nad working with JSON

**4. Spring Security - 10%**
   - Basic Authentication and Authorization
   - JWT and role-based access control
   - Working with restricted and sensitive data with spring security

**5. Microservices support - 10%** (Eureka, Feign, Hystrix whichever applicable)
   - Service discovery
   - Feign for rest clietns
   - Resiliency and circuit breaking with spring

**6. Testing (JUnit, Mockito) - 5%**
   - How to test spring boot components
