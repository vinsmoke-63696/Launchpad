Rules ->
1. ignore constants 
2. consider only largest


example -> f(n) = n^2 + 3n +1;
then complexity is O(n^2)
============================================
1. Always worst case is considered O(), however there are Average case Theta() and best case omega() too

===========================================
Time complexities from best to worst 
O(1) Best -> O(log n) -> O(n) -> O(n log n) -> O(n^2) -> O(n^3) -> O(2^n) Recurssion -> O(n!)
