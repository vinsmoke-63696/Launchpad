1. Types of Interfaces
    1. Marker Interfaces          (No methods or fields)
    2. Functional Interfaces      (1 abstract method, SAM, Single Abstract Method)
    3. Normal Interfaces          (1 or More Abstract Methods)
    4. Nested/Inner Interfaces    (Interface defined in another class or interface)
    5. Tagging Interfaces         (Similar to marker interface but emphasize their purpose as identifiers)
    6. Adapter/Callback Interface (Interface used to adapt or handle callbacks)
